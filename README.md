SQLite

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine. It is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of integration into applications. In this project, I learned how to set up an SQLite database, create tables, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the library better-sqlite3 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3).

What I Learned:

    How to connect to an SQLite database using Node.js.
    Creating tables and managing schemas for data storage.
    Performing SQL queries to retrieve data.
    Error handling and data validation during database operations.
