SQLite

SQLite is a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine. It is widely used due to its simplicity and ease of integration into applications. In this project, I learned how to set up an SQLite database, create tables, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Better-sqlite3 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3).

What I Learned:

    - How to connect to an SQLite database using Better-sqlite3.
    - Creating tables and managing schemas for data storage.
    - Performing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
